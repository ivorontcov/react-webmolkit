# react-webmolkit

This is a repository which contains React wrapper for WebMolKit.

In the future versions I will add NPM support, so it can be installed and integrated seamlessly to any React app.

## Quick Start (local development)

For local development clone this repo then run:

```
npm i
npm start
```

## Integrate with your app
